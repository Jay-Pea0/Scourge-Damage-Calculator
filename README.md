# Scourge Damage Calculator

Simple damage calculator made for Dungeoneer's Park's (currently) upcoming Scourge class for Dungeons and Dragons.

Calculates the average damage per turn at each level using given weapon damage dice, calculating the chance to hit (or crit), adding Strength score for that level (assume 3 to start, 4 from 4th, and 5 from 8th), and counting rolls lower than proficiency bonus as proficiency bonus.
